# Briscola-Bot
Basic implementation of the Italian card game Briscola.

Gameplay is explained here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola#Game_play.
The "bot" that the player plays against is programmed based on behaviours typically exhibited by real players of the game,
such as stockpiling cards of the dominant suit, claiming high-value cards when possible, and other strategic plays.

To start the game, simply run main.py with Python 3.
